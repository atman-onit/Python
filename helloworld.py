#basics
print("Hello world") # prints hello world
input("Enter value: ") #takes value


a =  input("Enter value 1: ") #takes value and assigns to variable a
b = input("Enter value 2: ") #takes value and assigns to variable b

# to print a variable we:-
print (a)
print (b)

#we can also print like
print("Value a is " +a)
print("Value a is " ,a)
print("Value a is ") 
print (a)

print(a+b) # let a=3, b=3, this code will output 33 for a+b
print("Yes, the answer is wrong as python takes input and outputs as strings\nWhen we write a+b, + is not summation rather concatenation.\nIt prints the variables as strings")

#for arithmetic operations define the input's variable type
print("This is code after input variable type is defined")
a = int(input("Enter value 1: "))
b = int(input("Enter value 2: "))
print (a+b)
